-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It would be better to have a remote repository when collaborating with others.
This allows other people to have easier access to the repository.


-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be conflicts between local and remote repository
and in that case, we need to resolve them manually.


-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

Fork happens only between GitHub and GitHub. No local repository involved.
Clones are when you copy to/from local repository.
Branches are when works split within a repository.
