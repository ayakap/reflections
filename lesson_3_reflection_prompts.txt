-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It would be better to have a remote repository when collaborating with others.
This allows other people to have easier access to the repository.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There may be conflicts between local and remote repository
and in that case, we need to resolve them manually.
