-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It would be better to have a remote repository when collaborating with others.
This allows other people to have easier access to the repository.


-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
 having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be conflicts between local and remote repository
and in that case, we need to resolve them manually.


-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
 When would you use one instead of another?

Fork happens only between GitHub and GitHub. No local repository involved.
Clones are when you copy to/from local repository.
Branches are when works split within a repository.

-What is the benefit of having a copy of 
 the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I have no idea. But I can compare my local copy with the remote 
without internet if I have that.

- How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? 
  What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be much harder to work on the same file at the same time
