-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It makes .git file and prepares to track what's there.
Because if we're going to keep track of something,  we have to start somewhere


-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area offers one extra step so we have more control over what we 
commit
