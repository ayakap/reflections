-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It makes .git file and prepares to track what's there.
Because if we're going to keep track of something,  we have to start somewhere


-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area offers one extra step so we have more control over what we 
commit


-How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
use git diff to compare working directory and staging area
use git diff --staged to compare staging area and most recent commit
use these two to see if that's really what i want


-What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
How would branches help?
Branches will be helpful whenever I want to make something new
without messing with the version that's already working.
For example, branches will be useful when I want to make
a version in different language or experiment with a new feature
while still having official working copy


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Well, diagrams looks like branch.
It looks exactly like how it works.
I don't know how else to answer this question.
